# Discord Bot that recommends game
Me and my friends always struggle to pick a game even with our huge backlog... so this is my attempt to help fix that problem.

### Features
So far:
- Says hello to you with $hello
- Ask it by starting your message with $rec, and then the question you want to ask! e.g. "$rec recommend me something similar to Valorant"
- User's chat history is saved

### Stacks
This project uses Python and OpenAI's GPT 4 to power the chatbot.
Might use a database in the future
